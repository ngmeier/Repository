Cities are growing and new buildings are being built, but so is the tension between fathers and daughters, between rivals fighting for the same heart, and most importantly, between the rich and poor. Egeus, father of Hermia, wants the best for his daughter. Egeus’ chosen suitor for his daughter is Demetrius, a man who comes from a wealthy family. Helena, Hermia’s friend, is in love with Demetrius, even though Hermia has been promised to him. Despite who her father thinks is best for her, Hermia is in love with Lysander, although he is impoverished.

Egeus explains to you what was just recently discussed. He informs you that he has given Lysander and Hermia 24 hours before they must say their goodbyes as it has been arranged for Hermia to marry you.

While pointing to Demetrius, Egeus said, 
“My noble lord. This man hath my consent to marry her. He hast cometh from a family of wealth and shall maketh a most wondrous suitor for mine own daughter.”
Then pointing to you, Egeus said,
 “My gracious duke, this is who my daughter hath chosen to marry. Lysander is nothing but a beggar who cannot provideth.
While laughing, Demetruis continues to say “He is lesser than the dirt under mine own feet.”

As the sun lowers itself down behind the horizon you grow weary and lay under a tree to rest.
	While you sleep there are greater powers at work. In an attempt to fix his earlier mistake, the mischievous Puck squeezes the juice from a wildflower onto your eyelids. A simple but quite potent bit of fairy magic, this charm will cause the subject to fall madly in love with the first being they lay eyes on when they awaken.
	You’re roused by voices and see Helena steps forward through the brush, followed by Lysander, followed by Hermia. Calling out ahead to Helena, Lysander professes his love to her,

Lysander:
	“Content with Hermia? No! I do repent
	The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
	Not Hermia, but Helena I love.
	Who will not change a raven for a dove?”

Helena:
	“Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
	When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
	Is’t not enough, is’t not enough, young man,
	That I did never, no, nor never can,
	Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius’ eye,
	But you must flout my insufficiency?”

	Seeing both Helena and Hermia now in the glade, you cannot help but realize Helena’s beauty. Enchanted, it seems clear - it is not Hermia who is the one for you but Helena!

As the two of you brawl, Puck comes by and realizes he made a big mistake. 

The previous day, Helena, Hermia’s best friend, warned Demetrious about your escape from Athens with Hermia. Upon hearing the news, Demetrious decided to follow the two of you into the woods in hopes of stopping your hasty marriage. However, Helena is in love with Demetrious and chased after him into the woods in an effort to win his heart. Sadly, Demetrious did not feel the same way and told Helena to leave him which resulted in their bickering. Puck noticed the unhappy pair and decided to help them out by sprinkling a love potion in Demetrious’ eyes that night. The potion would make him fall in love with the first person he saw (Helena). Unfortunately, Puck made a mistake and also sprinkled the potion into your eyes! This is why you instantly fell in love with Helena when she woke you up! 

As Puck is realizing what a horrible mistake he had made, Helena and Hermia also break out into a fight as Hermia is now angry with Helena for stealing Lysander’s heart away. 

Hermia:
You juggler! You canker-blossom! 
You thief of love! What, have you come by night 
And stol’n my love’s heart from him?

Amidst all the fighting, Puck hatches a new plan. As the sun sets, it becomes harder and harder for you to see. You are now relying solely on the sound of Demetrious’ voice to figure out where he is, but he seems to be getting further away...

[[Follow the voice-&gt;Voices In Your Head]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Voices In Your Head" tags="" position="494,1901" size="100,100">	You follow this voice through the forest until you grow so tired you collapse from exhaustion. However, it was not actually Demetrious’ voice who had been leading you through the woods, it was puck disguising himself as Demetrious to lure you to one side of the forest. Puck had done the same to Demetrious, except he lured him to the opposite side of the forest. Now that you two are separate, Puck is able to, once again, sprinkle the potion into your eyes but this time, he made sure Hermia was the only person around for you to wake up to. 
	Sure enough, Puck’s plan is a success. The commotion of her parting the underbrush wakes you, and you are once again, in love with Hermia. You want to express your love for her. 
	
&#39;&#39;What do you say?&#39;&#39;

Hermia:
&quot;Oh Lysander dear, with such grace thou speak&quot;
	It seems that Helena forgives you.
	Shortly after waking up, Egeus, Theseus, and Hyppolyta find you in the woods. Your heart sinks at the thought of you having to leave Hermia after everything you both have done to stay together. Fortunately, Egeus had a change of heart. While he won’t be happy if you and Hermia end up marrying, he still decides to let Hermia choose who she wants to be with. Hermia chooses to marry you and you both live out the rest of your days happily married. Lysander, still in love with Helena due to Puck’s potion, marries Helena.

Egeus:
No matter of love responds well to force,
There is no ease in an instant divorce, 
Therefor we mustn&#39;t make hubristic haste,
lest Hermia develop a distaste
for the man whom she shall marry
then say &quot;I do&quot; with feelings contrary.
Such arrangements favor neither bride nor groom,
but equally their bound hearts will be consumed.

After your chat with Egeus, you leave the court head back home. On your way you see Lysander and Hermia talking in the woods.

Lysander: 

I have a widow aunt, in dowager 
Of great revenue, and she hath no child. 
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues, 
And she respects me as her only son. 
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee. 

Infuriated with this news you know you have to do something. The way you see it, there are two options.

The two have slipped away unnoticed in the night, and by no they could be anywhere. You are shocked and disgusted by the lack of respect for Egeus the two have shown, and a little hurt that Hermia would rather be banished from her home than marry you. However, because of your exuberant wealth, you easily find a wife. The two of you spend your years together happily.
